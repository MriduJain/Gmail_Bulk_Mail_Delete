Gmail's interface does not support automated bulk delete operations, so you will have to repeat the process manually. 
However, you can partially automate the process using some tools. 
One method is to use Google Script, a programming language that can be integrated with Gmail. Follow the steps below:

Create a Google Script:

Log in to your Gmail account.

Go to Google Apps Script (https://script.google.com/).

Create a New Script:

Click on the "Start Scripting" button.


Paste the Code:

function deleteEmails() {
  var threads = GmailApp.search("from:sender@example.com");
  for (var i = 0; i < threads.length; i++) {
    threads[i].moveToTrash();
  }
}

use the mail id from which you wish to delete so many mails.

Save the Script:

Click on the save icon or usually gmail save it automatically.

On the right hand click Deploy button, click new deploy.
in the new window click icon in front of select type and select web app and then click Deploy then let it update and then Done.


Now Click on top row :

Allow the authorization to the script to access your Gmail account.

once authorization gets successful click on run and click on Execution log button to see progress.

You may need to click run multiple times as it depends on number of mails you have.

But once you see execution getting complete in just a second you can go to your gmail inbox and see the mails are deleted.

Please note that using scripts like these should be approached with caution, and you should understand the code you are running. 
Additionally, it's a good practice to test the script with a small set of emails before applying it to a larger number.
